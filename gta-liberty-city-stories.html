                    <p><strong>GTA Liberty City Stories</strong> is a standout entry in the Grand Theft Auto series. Originally released for the PlayStation Portable (PSP), it brings the open-world chaos and storytelling the series is known for to a handheld platform.

                    <p>Liberty City is the heart and soul of <strong>GTA Liberty City Stories PPSSPP ISO</strong>. Modeled after New York City, it is divided into three main islands: Portland, Staunton Island, and Shoreside Vale. Each area has its own unique vibe, challenges, and opportunities for exploration.</p>
                  
                    <p>Portland is the industrial heart of the city, with a strong Mafia presence and a gritty atmosphere.
