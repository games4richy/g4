                <h3>Three Playable Characters</h3>
                
                <p>Unlike previous GTA games, GTA 5 introduced three main protagonists—Michael, Franklin, and Trevor. Each character has a unique personality, special abilities, and distinct storylines that intertwine throughout the game.</p>
                
                <h3>Immersive Storyline</h3>
